Tahj Money
I don't know shit about no murder, gotta keep my mouth closed
Just got a brand new Desert Eagle with a cutter that fold
Shower in bleach, rip up the car, make sure you burn all the clothes
My youngin' down to shoot to kill just for a line of some coke
Sendin' texts to all the opps like yeah we want all the smoke
We up by six, they down by two, they need the go fix the score
Pop out wit' poles, told 'em I won't spare no kids or no hoes
Foot on the pedal, heavy metal, send some shots through yo' clothes
Take off his nose
None of my niggas gon' bend, break, or fold
Clutchin' cutters, me and my brothers ridin' 'round smokin' dope
I got a drop on all the opps, hope you don't think that you Low
This ain't no threat, bitch this a promise, when I catch you case closed
Money fold, dope sold, you caught a body but told
Spent 40 thousand on some diamonds, got my mouth lookin' froze
You sippin ' lean, that's not prescription, got 'em comin' by loads
Lord knows, walk in the mall and spend 10 thousand on clothes
I don't know shit about no murder, gotta keep my mouth closed
Just got a brand new Desert Eagle with a cutter that fold

We up by six, they down by two, they need the go fix the score
Pop out wit' poles, told 'em I won't spare no kids or no hoes
Foot on the pedal, heavy metal, send some shots through yo' clothes
I bought a chopper then I filled it up
I catch 'em, I'ma fill 'em up
Walk down, headshots, hit the corner, rip 'em up
Y'all better listen to the words I say, we livin' in our last days
Point blank, proven, ci-cigarettes and ash trays
I don't know shit about no murder, gotta keep my mouth closed
Just got a brand new Desert Eagle with a cutter that fold
