Ayy man, y'all know what
The fuck goin' on, man
Sniper gang shit, man big Z's, 26136, man
Savage squad, Glo Ganged up
You dig, you dig?
(1Mind)

Staying sober tryna drop albums
But I get high off of gunpowder
All this money keep a nigga calmer
But it ain't nothin' to hit your whole block up
But I ain't tryna go back to the bottom
About the jewelry, I'ma die about 'em
I'm glowed up, put that on my Z
I'm poured up, I'm on promethazine

I'm poured up, I'm on codeine (lean)
That bitch want me
She gotta do my team (my team)
We ride with 30s with
Them green beams (green beams)
Kidnap a rapper ass
Label gotta pay the fee
I'm super savage
Niggas know not to play with me (play with me)
Kick that bitch out, nah
She can't lay with me (fuck that thot)
Niggas switchin' teams, what?
Like they K.D (fuck them niggas)
But I'm really in the field like I'm A.B. (what)
Touchdown, hundred pounds up in AZ (let's get it)
It's goin' down, you out of
Bounds if you want beef (you know it)
Shoot a nigga down
Hundred round in my heat (grrrra)
I fuck my bitch and pop some
Xannys just to go to sleep (ya dig?)

Staying sober, tryna drop albums
But I get high off of gunpowder
All this money keep a nigga calmer
But it ain't nothin' to hit your whole block up
But I ain't tryna go back to the bottom
About the jewelry, I'ma die about 'em
I'm glowed up, put that on my Z
I'm poured up, I'm on promethazine

The only stretch I'm doin' from a nap
Turn a fuckin' crap to some craps
Bitch give me face
If you gon' do it, do it 'SAP
You say you want codeine
Grab a cup and get a tap
Blunt of that 'lato, ice kickin'
Ass, catch a combo
Zoom past faster than
A bullet out a gun hole
I ride, patrol out to get me
Gotta dodge 'em like a pothole
Told her that I'm on my way
To crack her like a taco
My flag with no stand, how
I'm mothafuckin' tiltin'
Livin' in the Hills, when you park
Turn your wheel in
Do a bitch bad, someone
Take me to detention
All this fuckin' loud, someone
Take me to the incense

Staying sober, tryna drop albums
But I get high off of gunpowder
All this money keep a nigga calmer
But it ain't nothin' to hit your whole block up
But I ain't tryna go back to the bottom
About the jewelry, I'ma die about 'em
I'm glowed up, put that on my Z
I'm poured up, I'm on promethazine

Sniper Gang, man, GBE,
You know how we rockin', man
Whole lot of gang shit, ya dig? Ya dig? Ya dig?
